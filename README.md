# Geo Location API

## Project Overview

This project is a simple API for finding the geographical location of an IP address. It uses the [IP-API](https://ip-api.com/) service to get the location information. 

## Features

* **IP Address Lookup:**  Retrieves geolocation data for a given IP address. 
* **Prisma ORM:** Uses Prisma to interact with the database (defined in `prisma/schema.prisma`).
* **Express.js:**  Built with Express.js for a robust and flexible API server.

## Installation

1. **Install Node.js and npm:**
    * If you don't have Node.js installed, download it from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).
2. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/geo_location.git
    cd geo_location
    ```
3. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Usage

1. **Start the server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
2. **Access the API:**
   * To get the geolocation data for a specific IP address, send a GET request to `/api/location/<IP_ADDRESS>`. For example:
      ```bash
      curl http://localhost:3000/api/location/8.8.8.8
      ```
